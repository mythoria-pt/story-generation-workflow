Now let us do an experiment: we will draw the bridge, glue a piece of paper on it with the word 'secret,' and write together what we think is on the other side. See? Learning is an adventure, too."

We take a thousand photos, invent five conspiracy theories on the spot, and, of course, nobody writes down where we actually found the key. Classic us."
