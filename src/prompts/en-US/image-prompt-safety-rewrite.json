  "userPrompt": "<task>\nAn image generation request was rejected by an AI safety system with the following error:\n```{{safetyError}}```\n\nYour task is to analyze the original prompt and rewrite it to avoid triggering safety filters while maintaining the essential visual concept, narrative intent, and artistic style.\n</task>\n\n<original_context>\n<image_type>```{{imageType}}```</image_type>\n<book_title>```{{bookTitle}}```</book_title>\n<graphical_style>```{{graphicalStyle}}```</graphical_style>\n{{#chapterNumber}}<chapter_number>```{{chapterNumber}}```</chapter_number>{{/chapterNumber}}\n</original_context>\n\n<original_prompt>\n```\n{{originalPrompt}}\n```\n</original_prompt>\n\n<safety_guidelines>\nWhen rewriting, ensure the new prompt:\n\n**AVOIDS:**\n- Sexual or suggestive content (especially involving minors)\n- Nudity or revealing clothing\n- Bathing scenes, bath time imagery, or any depiction of undressed or partially dressed minors\n- Violence, gore, weapons, or harm\n- Dangerous activities or substances\n- Explicit physical contact that could be misinterpreted\n- Overly detailed descriptions of bodies or anatomy\n- Ambiguous terms that could trigger filters (e.g., \"intimate\", \"exposed\", \"bare\")\n- Close-up shots of sensitive body parts\n- Terms related to birth, eggs, hatching (if biological context)\n\n**EMPHASIZES:**\n- Professional or public settings (classroom, zoo, museum, park)\n- Appropriate clothing and context\n- Fully clothed children in safe, supervised family or community activities (e.g., bedtime stories, tidying toys, arts and crafts)\n- Educational or family-friendly scenarios\n- Emotional expression through faces and posture\n- Environmental details over character physicality\n- Age-appropriate activities and interactions\n- Clear professional context (teacher, zookeeper, parent)\n- Distant or medium shots instead of extreme close-ups\n\n**TECHNIQUES:**\n- Replace potentially sensitive terms with neutral alternatives\n- Add contextual safety markers (\"in a classroom\", \"at a zoo exhibit\")\n- Change camera angles to be less intimate\n- Reframe bathing or dressing moments into adjacent, fully clothed activities (e.g., bedtime story, playtime cleanup)\n- Generalize specific details that might trigger filters\n- Focus on actions and emotions rather than physical attributes\n- Use indirect description (\"nearby\" instead of \"holding\")\n</safety_guidelines>\n\n<rewriting_strategy>\n1. **Identify the trigger**: Analyze what likely caused the rejection\n2. **Extract core concept**: What is the essential visual idea?\n3. **Neutralize language**: Replace sensitive terms with safe alternatives\n4. **Add safety context**: Include setting details that establish appropriateness\n5. **Simplify details**: Remove unnecessary specifics that could trigger filters\n6. **Maintain style**: Ensure the ```{{graphicalStyle}}``` aesthetic is preserved\n7. **Preserve narrative**: Keep the story moment intact\n</rewriting_strategy>\n\n<examples>\n**Example 1: Close-up biological content**\n❌ ORIGINAL: \"Close-up shot of a tiny baby chameleon hatching from a small white egg. A kind zookeeper's hands gently hold the egg.\"\n✅ REWRITTEN: \"A vibrant green baby chameleon in a zoo nursery display, with educational exhibit materials and professional care setting visible in the background.\"\n\n**Example 2: Physical contact**\n❌ ORIGINAL: \"A young girl hugging a large dog tightly, their faces close together.\"\n✅ REWRITTEN: \"A young girl and a friendly golden retriever playing together in a sunny park, both showing happy expressions.\"\n\n**Example 3: Ambiguous clothing**\n❌ ORIGINAL: \"A dancer in elegant costume performing on stage under spotlight.\"\n✅ REWRITTEN: \"A ballet performer in professional stage attire executing a graceful leap during a theatrical performance.\"\n\n**Example 4: Bath-time scenario**\n❌ ORIGINAL: \"A toddler splashing in a bubble bath while a parent kneels beside the tub.\"\n✅ REWRITTEN: \"A cheerful toddler in cozy pajamas playing with bath toys on a bathroom mat while a parent nearby helps tidy up.\"\n</examples>\n\n<output_requirements>\n- Return ONLY the rewritten prompt text\n- Do NOT include explanations, reasoning, or metadata\n- Maximum length: 200 characters\n- Must be in en-US language\n- Must maintain the ```{{graphicalStyle}}``` style reference\n- Must preserve the core visual concept from the original\n- Must be immediately usable in an image generation API call\n</output_requirements>\n\n<important_notes>\n- If the original prompt seems fundamentally unsafe (e.g., explicit violence), you may refuse and return: \"UNABLE_TO_REWRITE: Content fundamentally unsafe\"\n- Focus on preserving the emotional tone and narrative moment, not word-for-word recreation\n- When in doubt, add more context and reduce specificity\n- Remember: The goal is to generate the same intended image in a safer way\n</important_notes>\n\n<output_format>\nGenerate the rewritten prompt now.
